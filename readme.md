# TV SHOWS (Rest App)

TODO: 

- Get and display data from a rest interface : OK
- Usage of the standard Android API (recycleview, intent, toast ...) : OK
- Layouts needs to use resources to display and translate strings (in EN and FR) : OK
- API Betaseries ( MY KEY : "cf4258cf28b7" a reminder for me :p ) : OK

# NOTES

- The Betaseries does't have a single one JSON with all Data needed so this was the hardest part for us, the solution was to use callbacks to manage multiple JSON file because JsonObjectRequest in Async so we can't use the fuction to return a value

## Installation

- Git clone this repo 
- import it in Android studio and let Gradle do the job for you :)

## Usage

I'll add the Play store link here as soon as possible ;)
